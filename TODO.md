- [x] **README.md** - Complete project documentation and usage guide

### Features Implemented
- [x] Text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion
- [x] Advanced controls (guidance scale, inference steps, dimensions)
- [x] Negative prompt support
- [x] Real-time progress tracking
- [x] Automatic image saving with timestamps
- [x] GPU/CPU compatibility
- [x] Memory management with model clearing
- [x] Example prompts for easy testing
- [x] Modern, responsive Gradio interface

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860`

### 4. Test the Application
- Try the example prompts provided in the interface
- Experiment with your own creative prompts
- Test different settings and parameters

## ðŸ“‹ Optional Enhancements

### Performance & Features
- [ ] Add support for different Stable Diffusion models
- [ ] Implement image-to-image generation
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Include image upscaling options
- [ ] Add style transfer features

### User Experience
- [ ] Implement user accounts and image history
- [ ] Add image download/sharing functionality
- [ ] Create preset styles and themes
- [ ] Add image editing tools (crop, resize, filters)

### Production Ready
- [ ] Add authentication and API keys
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create Docker containerization
- [ ] Add cloud deployment options

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Interface loads without errors
- [ ] Text prompts generate images
- [ ] Images are saved to `generated_images/` folder
- [ ] Progress bar shows during generation
- [ ] Settings controls work properly

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Negative prompts work correctly
- [ ] Different guidance scales produce varied results
- [ ] Custom dimensions generate properly sized images
- [ ] Model clearing frees up memory
- [ ] GPU acceleration works (if available)

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in README.md
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify GPU drivers and CUDA installation (if using GPU)
4. Check available disk space for model downloads
